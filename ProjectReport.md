### Theory
Non-newtonian fluids are - types - plot of different types

expected velocity for shear thinning and shear thickening fluids

Egs. of shear thinning fluids

Blood and importance, Wall Shear Stress

### Objective
1. Simulate blood and observe the effect of non newtonian model
2. To understand scenarios where non newtonian models are significant
3. 

### Modified Algorithm
Scheme - where is the viscosity, averaging for flux computation
Just add the algorithm `plot here` 
highlight key changes wrt fluidchen

### Pipe Flow with Inflow Boundary
Newtonian model - velocity profile does not change
physics + boundary condition

WSS shear stress varies with viscosity. Re
add results for WSS

plots - velocity, viscosity contours
+ graphs for velocity, viscosity, pressure

### Pressure Driven Pipe Flow
yes, works. add some observations - about viscosity in the domain . 
and why we need it. 

compare velocity profile for two viscosities (newtonian) + 
compare vel profile for newtonian and non newtonian 



### Simulating Blood Flow
just add observations

talk about cases when effect can be more severe, like curved cases, pressure fluctuation at source (heart), elastic walls, etc. 


### Channel with step

### Channel with Obstacle

### Key conclusions
1. WSS shear stress varies with viscosity. Re
2. Inflow boundary condition leads to same steady state velocity profile in pipe flow
3. Pressure driven flow yields different velocity profile for same applied pressure drop across it - 
4. Non Newtonian effects are dominant in unsteady cases at low Re (high viscosity).
